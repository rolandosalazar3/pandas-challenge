You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

In comparing and analyzing the two data sets, schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv, the school data was examined at the district level, by school, math scores by grade level, reading scores by grade level, and scores based on the schools spending.
